# Bot AI

This project now uses **Next.js** instead of Create React App.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

`npm run build` exports a static site into the `build` folder. `npm start`
serves that folder locally. All environment variables must use the
`NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix so they are available in the browser.
